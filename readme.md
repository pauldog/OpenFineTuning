The idea is to create a human currated set of question/answer pairs for fine tuning a LLM which is opensource and copyright free.

To add new questions to the training data, the best place to add them is the Wiki page.

For reference the Alpaca traing set is [here](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/main/alpaca_data.json)
